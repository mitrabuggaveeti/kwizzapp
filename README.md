All users can utilize the online application Kwizzapp. 
By sharing the quiz code, users only need to log in in order to create and participate in quizzes. There are several applications that can make quizzes, but the concept of producing a quiz, taking it on the same platform, and grading the students in such an amazingly simple method is pretty novel. 
The teacher creates the quiz and has control over who can take it and share it. The app will offer a special quiz code that may be shared with students once public access is enabled. 
Students will enter the quiz using the quiz code to participate and prevent spam submissions from anonymous users. 
The maker/teacher of the quiz will receive a list of the students and their results for the relevant quizzes.
